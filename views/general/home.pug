	p Welcome to Weasie.com, the home page of Ryan "Weastie" Weast.
	| Here is where I place the projects I work on, as well as 
	| occassional technical blogs. Unfortunately, I have deleted
	| (on accident or on purpose) most of the projects I built in the past,
	| especially considering that this is the 7th or 8th remake of weastie.com
	p Feel free to explore the site. Here's a todo list:
	ul
		li Implement email verification (my old site had this)
		li Upload CTF writeups (video or text)
		li Expand brash brawl to allow multiple servers
		li Add comments to blog posts
	hr
	p Weastie.com is open source! Check out the github for:
		ul
			li
				a(href='https://github.com/Weastie/weastie') Weastie.com main
			li
				a(href='https://github.com/Weastie/BrashBrawl_Server') Brashbrawl Server
